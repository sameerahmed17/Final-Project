            "Short Courses ARE BIGGEST SCAMS! We all want shortcuts. We all want to climb up that ladder fast. However, sustainable impact can’t come overnight. Short courses are good for learning. If you are struggling with a specific concept, a short course might be ideal for you. However, if you want to master a skill and earn a good income from it, short courses are not for you. You need to invest time to build a good portfolio. At xWave , we have been struggling with this demand. Students ask us to shorten course duration. But despite our best efforts, a skill like UX design, frontend development or even video editing requires a minimum of six months. We don’t want to compromise on quality. We expect students to spend considerable time in building three portfolio projects and 20+ short projects. Practice makes us perfect and practice demands time. What do you think?",

It was heartening to learn about their careers and how hashtag#IEC transformed them in last three years of operation. One student mentioned about the network support he received to run and scale his startup whereas other provided candid feedback on the alumni he hired through IEC. We work closely with hashtag#employers and incorporate their feedback to improve the quality of the grads that we produce. So far, IEC graduated 500 students and we have placed 316 in the market. This has been possible because of the work done by Asia Kanwal. All the leads that I generate, she is the one who converts them and helps us move forward and achieve the KPIs. I met her after two years of working online. Life at IEC is exciting! Join our community by enrolling at www.iec.org.pk",

This session brought together video editing students from hashtag#Faisalabad and students from the hashtag#Arifwala lab, managed by M Waqas Raza and Muhammad Muzamil. Additionally, students joined from Sindh and various cities across Pakistan. Can You Guess the Number of Students? In the session, students received a step-by-step guide on launching and managing a YouTube channel using AI tools, followed by a Q&A session. Many xWave students are already experienced, with some managing client channels as part of their work. After monetization, a channel can earn an average income of 30,000 to 40,000 PKR per month, depending on the topic. Regular work can help monetize a channel in about 5-6 months.Being camera-shy isn’t an issue—one can run a channel using “hashtag#cash cow” videos. If you're considering starting your own channel, feel free to hashtag#DM me to discuss a personalized plan. So, what are you waiting for?",

Let me share my journey with you. I only completed my matriculation due to personal issues that made me drop out of school. But I still had a passion for learning. Then I met Bilal Chatha from Chicago, who encouraged me to keep learning. As I learned, I decided to teach others too. For the past year, I've been teaching students at xWave. Last month, I wanted to take a break and visit Kashmir, but I didn't want to leave my classes. That's what motivates me every day to keep learning and teaching. My passion for teaching and my students are my driving forces! Seeing them learn and grow pushes me to keep going, even when I don't feel like it. What's your driving force that pushes you every day, even when you don't want to work or take a break? Tell me in the comments below!",
